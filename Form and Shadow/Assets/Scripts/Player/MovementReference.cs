    --Movement Reference--
    Basic script attached to the player movement reference
    object on the Player_Character prefab that rotates the object's
    y rotation to be equal to the camera, and then PlayerMovement
    moves based on this object's rotation, rather than the camera
    to prevent relative camera movement.
